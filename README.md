 For this unitm we will need to write the website content, select images, create metadata, and generally plan out the concept and content that will be the basis of your website. You can choose any topic or idea for your website that combines historical, technical, and/or information about companies that relate to the history and technology of the Internet. You will need to use Git and GitHub to collaborate and Markdown as the syntax for your content, so you don't need to use any HTML yet. The more thought and time you put into this, the better your project will come out. You should think about the overall concept of your website and the audience you intend to serve i.e. children, teens, adults, etc... This is a lot of work and I'm forcing you to collaborate with another person since the only way to learn Git  is to have to use it to work with someone else. It is much easier to learn GIT with just using plain text; rather than trying to learn it, while you are learning to code.
